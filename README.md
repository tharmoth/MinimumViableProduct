# MinimumViableProduct - Gamejam 2023
## Concept
24 Hour Gamejam to get familiar with Godot

Shoot the grandmas and steal their cookies! You start off by having only a few cookies but greed and hunger make you crave more!
Buy your weapons and kill the grandmas before they reach the end of the maze!
